# Country Info App

A React application that allows users to search for countries, filter by region, and view detailed country information. The app supports user login and provides the ability to add/remove countries from a favorites list.

## Features

- **Search Countries**: Search countries by name.
- **Filter by Region**: Filter countries based on their region.
- **Favorites**: Add and remove countries from a favorites list.
- **Country Details**: View detailed information about a country, including capital, population, languages, and flags.
- **User Authentication**: Login functionality with session management.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Bootstrap for UI styling
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and lifecycle handling
- LocalStorage for storing favorites
- REST API integration for fetching country data

Project Report: REST Countries React Application

üîó Chosen API
The application uses the REST Countries API v3.1 to fetch data about all countries worldwide. This free and open-source API provides detailed information including:

Country name

Population

Region

Capital

Languages

Flags

‚úÖ Why This API?
No API key required

Up-to-date and comprehensive

Easy JSON format suitable for React integration

Supports filtering by region and country name

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. CORS Errors and Inconsistent Data
Issue: Sometimes the data structure differed slightly between countries (e.g., missing capital, inconsistent languages).

Solution: Implemented safe access using optional chaining (e.g., country.capital?.[0] || 'N/A') to prevent crashes.

2. Session Handling Without Backend
Issue: Without a backend server, managing user sessions and favorites locally was challenging.

Solution: Used sessionStorage and localStorage to simulate login/logout and save favorite countries.

3. Search and Filter Conflicts
Issue: Combining region filter and search led to unexpected behavior.

Solution: Refactored filtering logic to apply both conditions sequentially in a single useEffect.

4. "Remove from Favorites" Triggering Modal
Issue: Clicking the "Remove from Favorites" button also opened the country details modal due to event bubbling.

Solution: Used event.stopPropagation() to prevent the card's click handler from being triggered when removing a favorite.

5. Deployment Confusion
Issue: Confusion between GitHub Pages and Vercel deployments, and how to update deployed versions after code changes.

Solution: Resolved by using Vercel CLI and GitHub integrations, ensuring smooth redeploys on push.
